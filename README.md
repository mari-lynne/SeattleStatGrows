Teaching Materials for SeattleStatGrows Introductory R Course @ Fred Hutch

In addition here are some helpful resources I used when learning R:

### General R help
[Epidemiologists R Handbook](https://www.epirhandbook.com/en/)  
[Modern Statistics with R](https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/eda.html#tsplots)  
Don't forget to use the ?(your_function) to understand its inputs and outputs.  
That plus sitting with the error messages can often get you the answer faster than google, or even chatGPT, with time :)  

### Data Visualization
[STHDA GGPLOT Guide](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-essentials)  
[STHDA GGPUBR Guide](https://www.sthda.com/english/articles/24-ggpubr-publication-ready-plots)  
[Patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)  

### Stats/Machine Learning
[Teacups and Giraffes Tutorial](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/01_introToR.html) * A fun interactive guide for our fundamental stats concepts explored in R  
[Linear Regression Guide](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/)  
[Logistic Regression Guide](https://datatab.net/tutorial/logistic-regression)  
[SDTHA Regression and Machine Learning Articles](https://www.sthda.com/english/articles/11-machine-learning/)      
[CARET Package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/)  

[Survival Analysis Guide](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survival-analysis-basics) *Not covered in class, but I do have some slides + a teaching script which I can tidy and upload (email me if needed sooner!)  

### Cheat Sheets
https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/#listing-listing-page=1  
I mostly reccomend printing off the dplyr cheetsheet as well as the StringR one for manipulating text data, forcats is also very useful if you have a lot of factor data to clean.
