# Hypothesis exploring =========================================================

# Example: Does the summary exposure value (SEV) for “Unsafe water source” predict the percentage of deaths due to enteric infections across regions?

# Linear Regression:
# y = b0 + b1x + e
# Enteric_Deaths = b0 + bUnsafe water source + e

# Multiple Regression:
# Enteric_Deaths = b0 + bUnsafe water source + Unsafe sanitation + Iron Deficiency + e

# Note: Regression assumes observations are independent
# So multiple observations from the same countries/age groups invalidates that assumption
# Therefore for the regression examples we will just look at one year across all ages
# Later will show how to deal with longitudinal data :)

###  Reshape data from long to wide --------------------------------------------

# In R regression, each predictor (independent variable) must be its own column in the data frame.
# This is because lm() (and other modeling functions) expect each column to represent a single numeric variable you can assign a coefficient to.


# 'rei' will become separate columns for each risk factor

# 0 = Low burden region

# Tidy output: exponentiate coefficients to get odds ratios (OR)
tidy(logit_model, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE) # estimate is the beta but we've exponated to get our OR # run with exponentiate = FALSE


# Interpretation:
# - The odds ratio (OR) tells you how much the odds of being 'high burden'
#   increase for each 1-unit increase in SEV for unsafe water.
# - OR > 1 means higher SEV is associated with higher odds of high burden.


# In cases where predictors are non-linear or the relationship is complex, machine learning methods like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting may outperform logistic regression.
